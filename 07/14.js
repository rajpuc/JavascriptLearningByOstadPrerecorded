/**
 * ! * (i) Arithmetic Operators
 * *Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the operands. The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.
 * 1. +
 * 2. -
 * 3. *
 * 4. /
 * 5. %
 * 6. ++
 * 7. --
 */

/**
 * !(ii) Comparison (Relational) Operators
 * *The JavaScript comparison operator compares the two operands. The comparison operators are as follows:
 * 1.==  -> is equal to 
 * 2.=== -> identical(equal and of same type)
 * 3.!=  -> Not equal to
 * 4.!== -> Not identical 
 * 5.>   -> Greater than
 * 6.>=  -> Greater than or equal to 
 * 7.<   -> Less than
 * 8.<=  -> Less than or equal to
 */

/**
 * !(iii) Bitwise Operators
 * *The bitwise operators perform bitwise operations on operands. The bitwise operators are as follows:
 * 1.&  -> Bitwise And
 * 2.|  -> Bitwise Or
 * 3.^  -> Bitwise Xor
 * 4.~  -> Bitwise Not
 * 5.<< -> Bitwise Left shift
 * 6.>> -> Bitwise right shift
 * 7.>>> -> Bitwise Right shift zero
 */

/**
 * !(iv) Logical Operators
 * *The following operators are known as JavaScript logical operators
 * 1. && -> Logical And
 * 2. || -> Logical Or
 * 3. !  -> Logical Not
 */

/**
 * !(v) Assignment Operators
 * *The following operators are known as JavaScript assignment operators
 * 1. =  -> assign
 * 2.+=  -> Add and Assign
 * 3.-=  -> Subtract and Assign
 * 4.*=  -> Multiply and Assign
 * 5./=  -> Devide and Assign
 * 6.%=  -> Modulus and assign
