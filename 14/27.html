         * ! JS Functions
         * *Why function?
         * (i)  Code Reusability : Functions are defined only once and can be invoked many times, like in other programming languages.
         * (ii) Less Code : It saves a lot of code because you don't need to write the logic many times. By the use of  function, you can write the logic only once and reuse it.
         * (iii)Easy to understand : Functions separate the programming logic. So it is easier to understand the flow of the application because every logic is divided in the form of functions.
